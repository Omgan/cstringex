CStringEx
=========

Woah this brings me back in time. This is a C++ string utility class that I
wrote a long time ago. I remember being frustrated with the standard library and
annoyed with third party string classes and eventually decided to go ahead and
write my own. It is nearly complete in terms of useful features but there is no
real documentation. Looking at the class declaration in the header should make
things easy enough to figure out. Unfortunately, I never implemented string
formatting.
